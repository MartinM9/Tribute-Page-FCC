            <h2>Tesla's timeline:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span>July 10, 1856 - </span>Tesla was born to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire near the town of GospiÄ‡, in the territory of modern-day Croatia.</li>
                <li><span>1875 - </span>At the Polytechnic school Tesla began his studies in mechanical and electrical engineering.</li>
                <li><span>1882 - </span>In 1882 Tesla moved to Paris, to work as an engineer for the Continental Edison Company, designing improvements to electric equipment brought overseas from Edison's ideas.</li>
                <li><span>1882 - </span>In 1882, Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle used in alternators and pioneered the use of this rotating and inducting electromagnetic field force to generate torque in rotating machines.</li>
                <li><span>June 6 1884 - </span>On 6 June 1884, Tesla first arrived in the United States, in New York City with little besides a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, a former employer.</li>
                <li><span>1885 - </span>Tesla claims he was offered US$50,000 (~ US$1.1 million in 2007, adjusted for inflation) if he redesigned Edison's inefficient motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and economy.</li>
                <li><span>1886 - </span>The Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing was a company formed by Nikola Tesla in 1886.</li>
                <li><span>1887 - </span>During the initial years of electricity distribution, Edison's direct current was the standard for the United States and Edison was not inclined to lose all his patent royalties.</li>
                <li><span>April 1887 - </span>In April 1887, Tesla began investigating what would later be called X-rays using his own single terminal vacuum tubes (similar to his patent #514,170). This device differed from other early X-ray tubes in that it had no target electrode.</li>
                <li><span>May 16 1888 - </span>At an AIEE meeting on May 16, 1888, Nikola Tesla delivered a lecture entitled A New System of Alternating Current Motors and Transformers, describing the equipment which allowed efficient generation and use of polyphase alternating currents.</li>
                <li><span>1891 - </span>A Tesla coil is a type of resonant transformer circuit invented by Nikola Tesla around 1891.</li>
                <li><span>Jul 30 1891 - </span>On 30 July 1891, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States at the age of 35.</li>
                <li><span>1893 - </span>The International Exposition was held in a building which was devoted to electrical exhibits.</li>
                <li><span>1899 - </span>In 1899, Tesla decided to move and began research in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments.</li>
                <li><span>1901 - </span>Nikola Tesla began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility ca.</li>
                <li><span>1913 - </span>Tesla Patents Bladeless Turbine</li>
                <li><span>1915 - </span>There was a tragic mistake during the 1915 Nobel Prize involving Nikola Tesla and Edison.</li>
                <li><span>August 4 1915 - </span>Tesla was embroiled in other problems at the time, but when Marconi won the Nobel Prize in 1911, Tesla was furious.</li>
                <li><span>July 10 1934 - </span>The term teleforce refers to Nikola Tesla's macroscopic charged particle beam projector.</li>
                <li><span>January 7 1943 - </span>Tesla died of heart failure alone in room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel, on 7 January 1943.</li>
                <li><span>1960 - </span>'Tesla' Defined As a Unit of Measure</li>
